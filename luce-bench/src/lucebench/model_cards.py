"""Client-side model-card registry — resolve a card by model id.

Why this exists
---------------
luce-bench's thinking-control machinery (``_thinking.py``) is only correct
when it uses the *right* tokens for the *right* model. Historically a card
only arrived from ``/props.model_card`` on a lucebox server; against
OpenRouter / MLX the client fell back to a hardcoded Qwen family guess and
knew nothing about per-model terminators, reply reserves, or effort tiers.

This module gives luce-bench a **card registry** resolvable by model id,
mirroring the canonical cards in repo ``share/model_cards/``. The cards are
embedded at build time (see ``pyproject.toml`` force-include) into the wheel
as package data under ``lucebench/_model_cards/`` so the standalone PyPI
build carries them without reaching the repo tree.

Resolution order (see :func:`resolve_card`):
  1. ``/props.model_card`` — authoritative when present (lucebox server told
     us the exact card it loaded). source = ``"props"``.
  2. Bundled registry, keyed by :func:`normalize_model_card_stem`. source =
     ``"bundled"``.
  3. Nothing → ``(None, "none")``. The family fallback stays in
     ``_thinking.py`` (it operates on the model id, not a card).

A bundled-card id match is a HINT, not proof: OpenRouter ids, aliases, and
quant routes can normalize to a known stem while serving behavior that
disagrees with the card. The match selects *which* card to read; whether to
*trust* it for thinking control is gated separately (see
:func:`card_is_thinking_capable` and the capability gate in ``cli.py``).

TODO (Tier 2, deferred — see docs/client-thinking-budget.md):
  * client-side abort + re-prompt continuation
  * char/4 mid-stream reasoning-token estimate
  * CI drift guard comparing packaged card hashes to share/model_cards/

# Provider prefixes stripped before normalization. OpenRouter / HF route ids
# carry an ``org/`` segment (``qwen/qwen3.6-27b:free``) that is not part of
# the card stem. We only strip a leading ``<segment>/`` once — the canonical
# stem never contains a slash.
#
# Route / quant suffixes stripped after the last segment: OpenRouter appends
# ``:free`` / ``:nitro`` / ``:floor`` etc. after a colon. The card stem never
# contains a colon, so everything from the first colon on is dropped.

    """Mirror the server's ``normalize_model_card_stem`` with client extras.

    The server (``server/src/server/model_card.cpp``) normalizes a clean
    ``general.name`` from GGUF metadata: lowercase, ``space``/``tab``/``_`` →
    ``-``, keep ``[a-z0-9.-]``, drop other punctuation. luce-bench works from
    a *model id* sent on the wire (``qwen/qwen3.6-27b:free``), so before
    applying that rule we additionally:

      * strip a leading provider/org prefix (``qwen/`` → ``""``), keeping
        only the final path segment, and
      * strip a route/quant suffix introduced by a colon (``:free`` etc.).

    Examples::

        qwen/qwen3.6-27b:free   → qwen3.6-27b
