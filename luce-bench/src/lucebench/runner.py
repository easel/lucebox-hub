    Sampling fields (``temperature``, ``top_p``, ``top_k``) are sent
    only when explicitly set. Omitted fields let the server apply its
    own defaults — for luce-dflash this is the loaded model card's
    ``sampling`` section. Forcing values here would defeat that
    fallback and on Gemma 4 cause degenerate-decode collapse.

    ``extra_body`` is merged into the request body verbatim — use for
    server-specific knobs (e.g. ``chat_template_kwargs``,
    ``reasoning_effort``, provider routing hints).

    ``reasoning_effort`` sets the OpenAI/OpenRouter ``reasoning_effort``
    request field in think mode (``"low"`` / ``"medium"`` / ``"high"``);
    nothink always sends ``"none"`` regardless. Default ``"high"`` keeps
    the wire body byte-identical to pre-feature behavior.

    ``thinking_budget_tokens`` (Tier-1 native budget hint): when set AND in
    think mode, adds ``thinking.budget_tokens=N`` to the Anthropic-shape
    ``thinking`` block (mirrors lucebench.probe's think-low / think-medium
    modes). Unset → the field is omitted and the body is unchanged.

    ``client_thinking_budget`` (Tier-2 client abort + re-prompt): when set
    AND in think mode AND streaming, the runner counts reasoning tokens as
    the stream arrives (char/4 estimate) and, once the estimate exceeds N,
    stops reading the stream and issues a SECOND, non-streamed request that
    re-conditions on the captured partial reasoning plus the card's
    ``thinking_terminator_hint`` (else ``</think>\\n\\n``) as an
    assistant-prefill turn, think disabled. That continuation's answer is
    graded. This is a FRESH conditioned sample, not a resumption of the
    original decode. Per-row metadata lands under ``row["client_thinking"]``.
    Unset → byte-identical to the pre-feature path (no second request, same
    streaming). Reasoning that is neither marked by ``reasoning_content``
    deltas nor ``<think>`` tags is ``marking="unmarked"``: no boundary
    exists, so the run finishes normally and is never aborted.

    ``card_source`` / ``card_stem`` are provenance only — stamped verbatim
    onto the returned row for the result schema (see
    :mod:`lucebench.model_cards`). They do not affect the wire body.

    ``thinking_control_flag`` toggles the client-side prompt-level
    injection fallback (see :mod:`lucebench._thinking`). The default
    ``"off"`` keeps the wire body unchanged for back-compat. ``"on"``
    appends the family/card thinking token to the last user turn
    regardless of server; ``"auto"`` skips injection only when
    ``server_honors_api_flags`` is True (the preflight confirmed a
    lucebox stack via /props). Per-row injection metadata is returned
    under ``row["_thinking_injection"]`` so the CLI can stamp the
    top-level ``thinking_control_injection`` block on result.json.

    ``stream`` defaults to True so every row carries a ``ttft_seconds``
    measurement (time from request POST to the first delta chunk carrying
    real content or reasoning_content). Pass ``stream=False`` to fall back
    to the legacy single-shot POST — same wire body, no SSE parsing, no
    ttft. The streaming path also sets ``stream_options.include_usage`` so
    the final chunk still carries the usage block (prompt/completion
    tokens, server-side timings).

    The returned row is the bench schema used by lucebench.cli's
    summary table:
      pass, wall_seconds, ttft_seconds, streaming, prompt_tokens,
      completion_tokens, content, reasoning_content, finish_reason,
      finish_details, timings, http_status, error.

    false, ``reasoning_effort`` none, no Anthropic ``thinking`` budget) and its
    own ``max_tokens`` reply reserve. The model is conditioned on the captured
    partial reasoning followed by the terminator, so it should emit the visible
    answer directly rather than keep reasoning.

    This is a **fresh conditioned sample, not a decoder continuation** of the
    aborted stream — the server has no memory of the original decode; we simply
    feed the partial reasoning back as assistant context.

    Returns ``(content, ok)``. ``ok`` is False — and the row is flagged
    ``continuation="unsupported"`` by the caller — when the request errors, the
    provider rejects the assistant-prefill, or the answer comes back empty.
    NEVER raises: a provider-capability failure must not abort the benchmark.
