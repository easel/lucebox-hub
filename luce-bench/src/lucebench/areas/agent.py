r"""Agent-style probes for `--area agent`.

Pairs a real Codex-style system prompt (loaded from
``fixtures/agent_prompts/codex_*.md``) with a coding-task user message,
and checks whether the model produces agent-shaped output (tool calls,
code blocks, ``apply_patch`` envelopes). Complement to ``--area forge``
which exercises tool-calling protocol reliability with mock scenarios.
This probe measures the simpler upstream question: given a realistic
agent context, does the model engage as an agent at all?

Three classes of output count as PASS:

1. **Code block**: response contains a Markdown fence (\`\`\`).
2. **JSON tool-call envelope**: response contains a JSON object with a
   ``name`` field looking like a tool ("Read", "Edit", "Bash", etc.).
3. **apply_patch envelope**: response contains an ``apply_patch`` or
   ``*** Begin Patch`` string (the Codex apply-patch convention).

Failure modes the grader catches:

- Model regressed to narrative prose ("To do this, you would first...")
  without producing any code or tool envelope.
- Model produced markdown headers/paragraphs only.
- Model refused or echoed the prompt back.

Real SWE-bench-style execution grading is the follow-up (separate
``--area swe`` run-request); this probe is the lightweight signal that
the agent path is even wired up.

Why not bench_agent_loop.py: it reads ``~/.claude/projects/`` session
JSONL on the host (non-portable across machines). Why not
bench_agentic_session.py: it overlaps forge (tool-call protocol). This
module picks the gap forge doesn't cover: agent-shape on a realistic
agent system prompt.
