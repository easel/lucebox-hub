"""HumanEval-style code-completion cases + grader for `--area code`.

Mirrors the conventions of `bench_ds4_eval.py`: data lives in a JSON
fixture, this module exposes a CASES list + a grader. `bench_http_capability.py`
dispatches into this module when `--area code` is selected so HumanEval
runs flow through the same harness as ds4-eval (provider/server_info
capture, --parallel, --host-label, unified row schema).

Grading is intentionally lightweight: a completion PASSes if the joined
prompt + completion parses as syntactically valid Python. This catches
the obvious "model regressed to noise" failure mode without requiring a
sandboxed test runner. Real HumanEval pass@1 (executing unit tests)
remains a follow-up; the existing CLI `bench_he.py` runs that flow
under test_dflash and is not part of this --area path.

The 10-prompt set is identical to `bench_he_http.py`'s PROMPTS (the
canonical HumanEval-style mid-function completion set that lucebox
autotune uses). Vendored as JSON so the fixture stays language-agnostic.

    * **nonempty**: completion stripped is at least 8 chars long

    the function against test cases) requires a sandbox and isn't worth
    the complexity for an in-process bench. The "parses cleanly" signal
