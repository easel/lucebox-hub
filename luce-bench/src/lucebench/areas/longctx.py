"""Long-context frontier cases for `--area longctx`.

Mirrors the convention of `bench_ds4_eval.py` and `bench_humaneval.py`:
data lives here, the dispatcher in `bench_http_capability.py` is thin.

The case set is ported from `bench_http_frontiers.py`'s frontier probe —
deterministic prompts sized to hit a target token frontier (2k → 64k),
ending in a fixed instruction the grader checks for. Each frontier is a
single case so the regular bench harness can record per-case timings,
provider, server_info, etc. through the normal row schema.

Grading is single-line:

* **format_pass**: response starts with ``Risk:`` (the instruction asks
  for "exactly one sentence beginning with 'Risk:'").

We don't grade meaningful "risk" content because the prompt's haystack
is deliberately generic — what we're measuring is whether the model
follows the instruction-after-long-context pattern at all, not whether
the risk analysis is correct.

The standalone `bench_http_frontiers.py` still exists for lucebox's
autotune flow (which expects its specific CSV output format); this
module is the unified-harness entry. Phase 2 of the integration will
re-point autotune at the unified harness and we can delete the
standalone then.
