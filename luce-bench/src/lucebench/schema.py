"""Canonical luce-bench result schema (v1).

Background
----------
luce-bench result.json grew organically and now has two incompatible
in-the-wild shapes:

  * legacy (pre-0.2.5)  → rows have ``id, output, ok, graded_pass,
    strict_pass, thinking_tokens, wall_s``; top-level ``pass_rate`` is a
    FRACTION (0.5761).
  * current (0.2.7+)    → rows have ``case_id, content, pass, graded{},
    reasoning_tokens, wall_seconds``; top-level ``pass_rate`` is a
    PERCENT (77.17).

That divergence (plus a dead ``semantic_pass_rate`` column that's always
0.0 and a ``semantic_hint_rate`` diagnostic that gets misread as the
headline score) makes cross-version comparisons untrustworthy.

This module defines a single canonical shape both loaders and the
``luce-bench regrade`` CLI converge on, with explicit unit choices:

  * all ``*_rate`` fields are FRACTIONS in [0.0, 1.0]; the regrade CLI
    formats them as percents only at the markdown layer.
  * ``semantic_pass_rate`` is intentionally absent (no semantic judge is
    plumbed today). If you wire a judge in the future, emit results
    under ``metrics["semantic_judge"][<judge_id>]``.
  * ``semantic_hint_rate`` is preserved as a diagnostic only — call
    sites and docs MUST NOT treat it as the headline score.

Versioning
----------
``schema_version`` bumps when this file's shape changes. ``grader_version``
is composed from the per-area ``GRADER_VERSION`` constants — bump those
when a grader's extractor / line-match / hint semantics change, and the
re-grade CLI refuses to put runs with different ``grader_version``s in
the same comparison row.

We keep the structure as plain dataclasses (and ``to_dict`` helpers) so
the rest of luce-bench's stdlib-only / no-pydantic style holds.
