"""Unit tests for the ``agent_recorded`` area.

Covers:

* Fixture loads, is non-empty, and every case has the expected schema
  (id, prompt, verifier with type + expected_tools).
* The area is registered in the CLI's AREAS dict with the documented
  defaults.
* The three-bin grader (pass / partial / fail) maps the obvious
  positive/negative inputs to the right verdicts. Includes a refusal
  case, a stub case, and a "tool but no file" partial.

No live server. Each grader call is fed a canned ``row["content"]``.
