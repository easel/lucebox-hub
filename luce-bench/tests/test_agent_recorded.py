"""Unit tests for the ``agent_recorded`` + ``agent_recorded_v1`` areas.

Covers:

* Legacy v1 area (single-turn tool-schema coverage):
  - Fixture loads, every case has the expected schema.
  - Area registered in AREAS as ``agent_recorded_v1``.
  - Three-bin grader (pass / partial / fail) maps the obvious
    positive/negative inputs to the right verdicts.
* New multi-turn area:
  - Fixture loads with v1 schema (carries reference_response).
  - Mocked judge round-trips through the area runner end-to-end.
  - Cache speedup arithmetic.
* LLM judge:
  - Disk cache hit/miss with mocked client.
  - Verdict parsing (strict JSON + tolerant Markdown fence).
  - Missing API key path raises JudgeUnavailable.

No live server, no live judge — every API call is mocked.
