# lucebox — host CLI for the lucebox-hub container

This package ships *inside* the `ghcr.io/luce-org/lucebox-hub` Docker image
and is invoked from the host via the [`lucebox.sh`](../lucebox.sh) wrapper:

    lucebox.sh check          # `docker run … lucebox check`
    lucebox.sh configure
    lucebox.sh print-run

The wrapper is the only thing that runs on the host; everything else (host
checks, TOML config, docker daemon calls, benchmark orchestration, smoke
tests, model download) is Python in the container. Host facts (driver,
GPU, RAM, VRAM, systemd availability) are passed in via `LUCEBOX_HOST_*`
environment variables so the Python side doesn't reprobe.

Subcommands are defined in [`lucebox/cli.py`](lucebox/cli.py). See the
top-level [README.md](../README.md) for the user-facing flow.
